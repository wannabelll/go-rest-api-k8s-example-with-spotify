I have watched the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSvCAHoiHC_rqKbcu1ummWVpLTDBNZHH7 and done similar work, with the main difference being that I used the Spotify API instead of YouTube, as demonstrated in the videos. Thank you to https://github.com/askcloudarchitech for helping me understand how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD and write Helm charts.
